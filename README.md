# AI Advertisement Generator

A microservices-based AI application that generates product advertisements using Large Language Models (LLM) and Stable Diffusion image generation. The system automatically creates ad copy and corresponding visuals for products based on user input, with secure temporary image storage and download capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of 4 microservices:

- **Orchestrator** (Port 8000): Main API that coordinates the entire ad generation workflow and provides image download proxy
- **LLM Service** (Port 11434): Ollama service running Llama3 for text generation
- **Image Generator** (Port 5001): Stable Diffusion XL service for creating product images with temporary storage
- **Poster Service** (Port 5002): Mock service for posting/publishing generated ads

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy & Data Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: This application processes user inputs to generate advertisements. Please be aware:

- **Do NOT upload or provide any personally identifiable information (PII)** such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or any sensitive personal data
- **We do not monitor or filter user inputs** - it is your responsibility to ensure appropriate content
- **Generated images are temporarily stored** and automatically deleted after 10 minutes
- **Use this service responsibly** and in compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations
- **This is intended for product marketing content only** - avoid any content that could be harmful, inappropriate, or violate terms of service

By using this service, you acknowledge that you understand these limitations and agree to use the service responsibly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support (required for both LLM and image generation)
- **16GB+ VRAM recommended** (both services share GPU memory)
- **16GB+ System RAM**

### Software Requirements
- Docker Desktop with Docker Compose
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for GPU support in Docker)
- Windows 10/11 with WSL2 (if on Windows)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```powershell
git clone <repository-url>
cd Ai-Adv
```

### 2. Setup NVIDIA Docker Support
Ensure you have NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed. Verify with:
```powershell
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi
```

### 3. Start All Services
```powershell
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
- Build all custom Docker images
- Pull the Ollama image and Llama3 model (first run may take 10-15 minutes)
- Start all services with GPU support
- Set up internal networking between services

### 4. Verify Services are Running
Check that all services are healthy:
```powershell
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs orchestrator
docker-compose logs image-generator
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator: `http://localhost:8000`
- ‚úÖ LLM Service: `http://localhost:11434`
- ‚úÖ Image Generator: `http://localhost:5001`
- ‚úÖ Poster Service: `http://localhost:5002`

## üìù Usage

### Generate an Advertisement

Send a POST request to the orchestrator:

```powershell
# Using curl (if available)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/run" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "product": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
    "audience": "fitness enthusiasts",
    "tone": "energetic and motivating",
    "ASIN": "B08N5WRWNW",
    "brand_text": "SoundFit Pro",
    "cta_text": "Get Yours Today!"
  }'
```

Or using PowerShell with Invoke-RestMethod:
```powershell
$body = @{
    product = "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones"
    audience = "fitness enthusiasts"
    tone = "energetic and motivating"
    ASIN = "B08N5WRWNW"
    brand_text = "SoundFit Pro"
    cta_text = "Get Yours Today!"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/run" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

### Expected Response
The API will return a JSON object containing:
- Generated ad copy
- Image download URL for the generated product image (valid for 10 minutes)
- Posting status from the poster service

Example response:
```json
{
  "ad_copy": "Unleash your potential with SoundFit Pro Wireless Bluetooth Headphones...",
  "image_url": "http://localhost:8000/download/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.png",
  "post_status": {"status": "success", "message": "Ad posted successfully"}
}
```

### Download Generated Images
Images are temporarily stored and can be downloaded using the provided URL:
```powershell
# Download the generated image
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/download/[filename].png" -OutFile "advertisement.png"
```

**Note**: Generated images are automatically deleted after 10 minutes for security and storage management.

## üîß Configuration

### GPU Memory Management
Edit `docker-compose.yml` to adjust GPU memory allocation:

```yaml
environment:
  # Limit Ollama GPU memory
  OLLAMA_MAX_GPU_MEMORY: "8GiB"
  # Optimize PyTorch memory for image generation
  PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF: max_split_size_mb:128
```

### Model Customization
To use a different LLM model, modify the Ollama service entrypoint in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "ollama serve & sleep 3 && ollama pull mistral && wait"]
```

## üõë Stopping the Application

```powershell
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clears downloaded models)
docker-compose down -v
```

## üìä Monitoring & Logs

### View Real-time Logs
```powershell
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f orchestrator
docker-compose logs -f image-generator
```

### Check Service Health
```powershell
# API health checks
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/docs"  # FastAPI docs
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:11434/api/tags"  # Ollama models
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **GPU Not Detected**
   ```
   Error: NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver
   ```
   - Ensure NVIDIA drivers are installed
   - Verify NVIDIA Container Toolkit is properly configured

2. **Out of Memory Errors**
   ```
   CUDA out of memory
   ```
   - Reduce GPU memory allocation in docker-compose.yml
   - Close other GPU-intensive applications

3. **Model Download Fails**
   ```
   Error pulling model
   ```
   - Check internet connection
   - Restart the llm-service: `docker-compose restart llm-service`

4. **Service Won't Start**
   ```
   Port already in use
   ```
   - Check for conflicting services: `netstat -ano | findstr :8000`
   - Modify port mappings in docker-compose.yml

5. **Image Download Fails**
   ```
   Image not found or has expired
   ```
   - Images are automatically deleted after 10 minutes
   - Regenerate the advertisement to get a new download link
   - Check if the filename in the URL is correct

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging by adding to service environment:
```yaml
environment:
  - DEBUG=1
  - LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## üîÑ Development

### Local Development
For development without Docker:

1. **Setup Python Environment** (each service):
   ```powershell
   cd orchestrator
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Services Individually**:
   ```powershell
   # Orchestrator
   cd orchestrator
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

   # Image Generator (requires CUDA)
   cd image-generator
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001
   ```

### API Documentation
Once running, visit:
- Orchestrator API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Image Generator API docs: http://localhost:5001/docs
- Poster Service API docs: http://localhost:5002/docs

#### Key Endpoints
- **POST /run**: Generate complete advertisement (copy + image)
- **GET /download/{filename}**: Download generated images (expires in 10 minutes)
